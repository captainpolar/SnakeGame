# SnakeGame
https://captainpolar.github.io/SnakeGame

**Requirements:**
1. A computer with a Python code editor installed
2. The pygame module (if you do not have it installed, type *pip install pygame* in the terminal).

**How to play:**
1. Open the *SnakeGame.py* document on GitHub (https://github.com/captainpolar/SnakeGame/blob/main/SnakeGame.py)
2. Copy and paste the code into a **Python code editor** (ie. Pycharm)
3. Make sure you have the **pygame module installed** (if not type *pip install pygame* in the terminal).
4. Execute the code
5. Have fun!

**Game commands:**
- use the *keyboard arrows* to **move the snake around** and make it eat the food
- click the *SPACE* key to **play again** or *ESC* to **quit**

*Don't make the snake turn or bump into itself as that will make you loose the game.*

**Important Notice:**
- The game is still under development and new updates will come in the future. Therefore, please let me know if you find any bugs!
- In order to introduce myself to pygame, I followed a great tutorial from edureka.co on how to implement the snake game in Python.
- Feel free to ask any questions or share your ideas for the game.

Have a great day!
